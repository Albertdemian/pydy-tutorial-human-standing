First I forked the repository from link in google sheet 

cloned the repo to my local machine 

modifications: 
- created branch arms and added some modifications to readme and commited them

- created sub-branch "fingers" and did some modifications and commit
- tried to merge "fingers" back to arms ions were in conflict 

- I had to discard some modifications and then merged branches successfully

- then merged "arms" to "master" 

- created 4 branches "left_arm", "right_arm", "left_leg" and "right_leg" 

- did modifications to the readme file in all of them and commited them then pushed to server

- while merging back to master I managed to merge 3 branches out of 4 

- Turns out I did the same mistake with "right_arm" branch and tried to merge conflicts but this time conflicts were many 

- I merged the 3 branches but I deleted the last branch "right_arm" 

- I then removed the folder 'notebooks'
